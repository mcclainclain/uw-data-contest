# UW Athletics Data Science Contest Project

This was a project I worked on in coordination with the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Athletics department, specifically with a smaller research group called BIOS (Badger Inquiry on Sport). Teams were tasked with looking at different power NCAA sports conferences and discovering trends, mainly in looking at the rosters of all of the sports, and looking for demographic data or trends relating to their hometowns. 

My original team was tasked with looking at the SEC conference, and it ended up being that I had to complete the entire project on my own, so due to time constraints, I had to limit myself to 10 of the 14 SEC teams (as of December 2023).

The main three steps of this were web scraping all of the rosters, cleaning up all of the data between different schools, and then creating meaningful visualizations from that.
